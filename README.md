# EDx
EDx courses and workbooks. I started this late 2020 and want to get familiar with Python and how to manipulate files using code and analyze data. I have a few years experience with Java('for dummies' on a program called Emconex). I learned how to code without knowing I was coding. Basically a user interface to drage an drop java commands into a visual flow chart. I caught on to some syntax but basically just learned the logic.
Have experience with SQL and creating reports in a tool that visualizes queries.
