# EDx
EDx courses and workbooks. I started this late 2020 and want to get familiar with Python and how to manipulate files using code and analyze data.

1/8/22 - Coming back to this now. Had to re download Anaconda. Deleted some of the read me because it made me cringe. Don't really know what I am doing but trying to understand programming better and make it useful somehow.

Repository Structure:
EDX/SOURCE/COURSENAME/FILES.ipynb
  source = Name of institution (MIT, Michigan, IBM, etc...)
  Coursename = Best course number I can find in the EDx screen
  Files = file name givne.
